In the 1860s, he engineered a series of wars that unified the German states, deliberately excluding Austria, into a powerful German Empire under Prussian leadership.  With that accomplished by 1871, he skillfully used balance of power diplomacy to maintain Germany's position in a Europe which, despite many disputes and war scares, remained at peace.  For historian Eric Hobsbawm, it was Bismarck who \"remained undisputed world champion at the game of multilateral diplomatic chess for almost twenty years after 1871, [and] devoted himself exclusively, and successfully, to maintaining peace between the powers\".  However, his annexation of Alsace-Lorraine gave new fuel to French nationalism and promoted Germanophobia in France.  This helped set the stage for the First World War."

It is not known when or by whom the term was coined, but by 1928 Kurt Weill (\"Zeitoper\" in \"Melos\") was able to complain that it was more a slogan than a description.  Like \"opera buffa\" it used contemporary settings and characters, comic or at least satiric plots ('s \"Maschinist Hopkins\" is a sole tragic example) and aimed at musical accessibility.  Two distinguishing characteristics are a tendency to incorporate modern technology (\"Jonny spielt auf\": trains, \"Der Lindberghflug\": airplanes, \"Von Heute auf Morgen\": telephones, and even elevators) and frequent allusions to popular music, especially jazz.  This last, more than any social satire, earned the suspicion of the political right and ensured that it would not survive into the Nazi era.",

            "Westervelt massacre: The Westervelt massacre, also known as the Westerfield massacre, was an indigenous attack on a caravan of Dutch frontier settlers that occurred during the American Revolutionary War around 3:00 am on June 27, 1780 in Kentucky County, Virginia, the present day state of Kentucky.  It remains one of the largest massacres in Kentucky state history.  The settlers were traveling southeast from Low Dutch Station to Harrod's Town.  The settler relocation was in part a reaction to British Captain Henry Bird's invasion of Kentucky.  The area immediately east of Low Dutch Station had been overrun with British allied Indians.  Harrod's Town was fortified and a move south would lead the settlers away from Captain Bird's invading army from the north.  The caravan was ambushed in a surprise attack, during the night, after a day's travel of twelve miles.  The exact location of the massacre is not definitively known.  However, it is likely to have occurred at Floyd's Fork and Broad Run.  The caravan was formed by Jacobus Westervelt and consisted of forty-one settlers from ten different families.  Ten of the seventeen settlers killed were members of the Westervelt family.  The victims included men, women, and children.  The Indians responsible for the massacre were allied to the British and received \u20a45 for each victim's scalp cut off and returned to the British authorities.  The Indians were thus awarded \u20a485 by the British for massacring the Dutch settlers.  The Westervelt Massacre had a chilling effect on the region.  A number of settlers from Low Dutch Station joined Colonel George Rogers Clark's militia after the massacre."
