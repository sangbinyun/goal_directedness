It has a more rock-oriented sound than their earlier drone doom work, although in a very minimalist style. 'Peace in Mississippi' is a cover of the Jimi Hendrix song. The original vinyl release of this album has an alternative take of 'Peace in Mississippi'. The car depicted on the cover is a 'Sassy Grass Green' Plymouth Barracuda with the car's iconic hockey-stick decal saying 'Earth.' The 'Pentastar' named in the album title is an apparent reference to the brand logo of Chrysler, parent company of Plymouth and also a reference to the fact that this is the fifth CD by Earth (its predecessor being 1995's Sunn Amps and Smashed Guitars).",

In the 1860s, he engineered a series of wars that unified the German states, deliberately excluding Austria, into a powerful German Empire under Prussian leadership.  With that accomplished by 1871, he skillfully used balance of power diplomacy to maintain Germany's position in a Europe which, despite many disputes and war scares, remained at peace.  For historian Eric Hobsbawm, it was Bismarck who \"remained undisputed world champion at the game of multilateral diplomatic chess for almost twenty years after 1871, [and] devoted himself exclusively, and successfully, to maintaining peace between the powers\".  However, his annexation of Alsace-Lorraine gave new fuel to French nationalism and promoted Germanophobia in France.  This helped set the stage for the First World War."

Like \"opera buffa\" it used contemporary settings and characters, comic or at least satiric plots ('s \"Maschinist Hopkins\" is a sole tragic example) and aimed at musical accessibility.  Two distinguishing characteristics are a tendency to incorporate modern technology (\"Jonny spielt auf\": trains, \"Der Lindberghflug\": airplanes, \"Von Heute auf Morgen\": telephones, and even elevators) and frequent allusions to popular music, especially jazz.  This last, more than any social satire, earned the suspicion of the political right and ensured that it would not survive into the Nazi era.",

It remains one of the largest massacres in Kentucky state history.  The settlers were traveling southeast from Low Dutch Station to Harrod's Town.  The settler relocation was in part a reaction to British Captain Henry Bird's invasion of Kentucky.  The area immediately east of Low Dutch Station had been overrun with British allied Indians.  Harrod's Town was fortified and a move south would lead the settlers away from Captain Bird's invading army from the north.  The caravan was ambushed in a surprise attack, during the night, after a day's travel of twelve miles.  The exact location of the massacre is not definitively known.  However, it is likely to have occurred at Floyd's Fork and Broad Run.  The caravan was formed by Jacobus Westervelt and consisted of forty-one settlers from ten different families.  Ten of the seventeen settlers killed were members of the Westervelt family.  The victims included men, women, and children.  The Indians responsible for the massacre were allied to the British and received \u20a45 for each victim's scalp cut off and returned to the British authorities.  The Indians were thus awarded \u20a485 by the British for massacring the Dutch settlers.  The Westervelt Massacre had a chilling effect on the region.  A number of settlers from Low Dutch Station joined Colonel George Rogers Clark's militia after the massacre."

Devon County War Memorial: The Devon County War Memorial is a First World War memorial, designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens and situated on the cathedral green in Exeter, the county town of Devon, in the south west of England.  It is one of fifteen War Crosses designed by Lutyens to a similar specification, and one of two to serve as a civic memorial in a city.  The first proposal for the county's war memorial was to complete the construction of a cloister at Exeter Cathedral to be dedicated to the Devon's war dead, but this scheme was abandoned due to lack of funds.  After considering multiple proposals, the Devon County War Memorial Committee commissioned Lutyens to design a War Cross instead.  The committee chose to site the memorial on the green of Exeter Cathedral after scouting several locations.  A war memorial for Exeter itself was being considered concurrently, but the committees for the two projects failed to work together, resulting in two separate memorials\u2014the county memorial by the cathedral and Exeter City War Memorial in Northernhay Gardens.",

The committee quickly raised \u00a310,000 but finding a suitable location for the monument proved controversial.  The preferred site in Albert Square, requiring the removal and relocation of several statues, was opposed by the city's artistic community.  The next choice was Piccadilly Gardens, an area ripe for development, but in the interests of expediency, the council chose St Peter's Square, although it already contained a memorial cross to the former St Peter's Church.  Negotiations to move the cross were unsuccessful and the war memorial was built with the cross in situ.",

Proposals for commemorating York's war dead originated in 1919 but proved controversial.  Initial discussions focused on whether a memorial should be a monument or should take on some utilitarian purpose.  Several functional proposals were examined until a public meeting in January 1920 opted for a monument.  The city engineer produced a cost estimate and the war memorial committee engaged Lutyens, who had recently been commissioned by the North Eastern Railway (NER) to design their own war memorial, also to be sited in York.  Lutyens' first design was approved, but controversy enveloped proposals for both the city's and the NER's memorials.  Members of the local community became concerned that the memorials as planned were not in keeping with York's existing architecture, especially as both were in close proximity to the ancient city walls, and that the NER's memorial would overshadow the city's.  Continued public opposition forced the committee to abandon the proposed site in favour of one on Leeman Road, just outside the walls, and Lutyens submitted a new design of a War Cross and Stone of Remembrance to fit the location.  This was scaled back to the cross alone due to lack of funds.",

It was designed by the architect Sir Edwin Lutyens.  The proposal for a memorial to Spalding's war dead originated in January 1918 with Barbara McLaren, whose husband and the town's Member of Parliament, Francis McLaren, was killed in a flying accident during the war.  She engaged Lutyens via a family connection and the architect produced a plan for a grand memorial cloister surrounding a circular pond, in the middle of which would be a cross.  The memorial was to be built in the formal gardens of Ayscoughfee Hall, which was owned by the local district council.  When McLaren approached the council with her proposal, it generated considerable debate within the community and several alternative schemes were suggested.  After a public meeting and a vote in 1919, a reduced-scale version of McLaren's proposal emerged as the preferred option, in conjunction with a clock on the town's corn exchange building.",

            "10. Olga de Amaral: Olga de Amaral was born as Olga Ceballos Velez in Bogot\u00e1, Cundinamarca, Colombia to parents from the Antioquia region of Colombia.  She was raised in a traditional religious family with 5 sisters and 2 brothers.  She grew up in a traditional neighbourhood in Bogot\u00e1 in a warm, safe family atmosphere, maintaining a special relationship with her loving and caring mother.  Upon graduating from high school, in the years 1951-52 she got a degree in Architectural Design at the Colegio Mayor de Cundinamarca in Bogot\u00e1.  After graduation, the future textile artist worked for a year as a director of the Architectural Drawing Faculty at the same school.  In 1954, de Amaral went to the United States to study English in New York at the Columbia University.  She then moved and studied fiber art at the Cranbrook Academy of Art in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan, USA (1954\u201355).  The artist cherishes that period of her education and considers it crucial for her later artistic development: \"In Cranbrook, the textile workshop had eight looms placed against the windows: one of them, in the corner, would be my home for a year.  There, I lived my most intimate moments of solitude; there was born my certainty about color; its strength; I felt as if I loved color as though it were something tangible.  I also learned to speak in color.  I remember with nostalgia that experience in which souls touched hands\".  At Cranbrook de Amaral met Jim Amaral and they became close friends.  In 1955, after a year in Cranbrook, she returned to Colombia and started to make decorative textiles on commission for her architect friends.  Meanwhile, Jim Amaral was in the U.S. Navy, on a base in the Philippines.  In 1956, Jim visited Colombia to see Olga, initially for a few weeks.  Shortly after, Jim Amaral and Olga Ceballos Velez married and settled in Bogot\u00e1.  They started a family (children Diego and Andrea) and a workshop of handwoven textiles.  During that period, Jack Lenor Larsen visited Colombia and the Amaral's workshop.  He expressed interest in Olga's tapestries.  Their professional and artistic relationship became crucial in projection of her work internationally in the world of contemporary tapestry.  In 1965 de Amaral founded and taught at the Textile Department at the Universidad de los Andes (University of the Andes) in Bogot\u00e1.  In 1966-1967 the Amaral family lived in New York.  There Olga de Amaral met Eileen Vanderbilt from the World Crafts Council and became its representative for Colombia.  With Jack Lenor Larsen's collaboration, Olga de Amaral displayed her tapestries in New York (solo exhibition in Jack Lenor Larsen\u2019s New York showroom in 1967), taught at Penland School of Crafts in North Carolina and in Haystack Mountain School of Crafts in Maine.  After returning to Colombia, the Amarals travelled to Popay\u00e1n and Tierradentro region with its must-see San Agust\u00edn.  Later Olga visited Peru as the WCC representative.  On a rapid visit to Ireland to participate in a WCC conference, Olga met Lucie Rie, a British ceramist who inspired her to incorporate gold into the tapestries.  At the beginning of the seventies, the Amarals moved to Barcelona and then to Paris.  They visited Greece, Italy, Holland, Belgium, Switzerland, Sweden, and England.  They made contacts with the centres of European art.  They lived for a time in Europe, then returned to Bogot\u00e1, visited different areas of Colombia, and then went back to France, amid exhibits, work, and new friendships.  Another important journey for the artist was her travel to Japan.  Nowadays Olga de Amaral lives and works in Bogot\u00e1, Colombia."

These duties varied greatly and, as an example, included mass feeding of civilians, camp sanitation, provision of medical supplies, containment of epidemic diseases, labor relations and rodent control.  The Theatre Planning & Research Division developed plans for military government at a national level such as control of Japan's economic institutions, control of Japan's education system and methods for increasing the overall supply of food throughout, not only Japan, but also previously occupied areas like East China.

            "1. Temperate forest: Temperate forests correspond to forest concentration formed in the northern and southern hemisphere, or in temperate regions.  It is the same as a tropical forest except for the climate and some of the animals adaptations.  Main characteristics include: wide leaves, large and tall trees, large wild canopy and non seasonal vegetation.  Temperate forests can be further distinguished by weather patterns and geographical features that favor the predominance of certain kinds of trees.  In temperate coniferous forests, evergreen conifers predominate, while in temperate broadleaf and mixed forests, a more even distribution exists between evergreen trees and deciduous trees.  Temperate deciduous forests, a subgroup of temperate broadleaf forests, consist of trees that lose their leaves every year.  Finally, temperate rainforests typically have heavy rainfall and dense humidity.  But in some temperate forests there are just trees with needles and do not shed their leaves during the winter, so the climate is a little different and not as cold.  They are also known as montane forests.",

During the initial year of putting the band together and working on new material the band wrote and independently released the single, \"Shock\" in 1991 which rose to the top of the dance charts.  Industrial dance music ruled the charts in Europe along with strong ties to Chicago, Wax Trax Records, and Houston.  Subsequent releases of \"Cut the Skin\" and \"Shoot to Kill\" gained national exposure on the dance charts and club scene.  \"Never Again\" was self-released as a radio single and quickly rose to the top of Houston Radio Station's 93Q and 96.5 attracting the attention of independent record label Alpha International.  Stephen Bogle produced the single of \"Never Again\".  The band wrote and produced the album \"Leave Me Alone\" but due to the bankruptcy of Alpha International the record sat idle.  It was released but there were no marketing efforts behind it.  After the release of the album, the band sought out drummer Max Schuldberg and they played their first concert as a foursome opening for Peter Murphy at Southern Star Amphitheater.  They played concerts in Texas as a foursome for two years.  Along with the three founders and newest member Max Schuldberg, the band added producer Stephen Bogle as guitarist to complete the line up.  The band recorded and produced \"Grip\" under their own start up label, Gut Records.  \"Grip\" went on to sell 15,000 units with the help of a crafty rework of Bad Company's \"Feel like Makin Love\".  Universal Records, at the time a brand new start up label, heard of the success of \"Grip\" and signed the band as their second artist ever.  \"Devil Thumbs a Ride\", the 3rd album, had already been recorded and mastered and was about to be manufactured for another self-release when Universal stepped in to sign the band and release the album as-is.  The Hunger had a hit song in 1996, \"Vanishing Cream\", from the \"Devil Thumbs a Ride\" CD, which received heavy airplay on rock stations and reached No. 4 on the Mainstream Rock charts.  After two years of constant touring, the band finally stopped to record their second release with Universal Records, \"Cinematic Superthug\".  After only moderate success with the single, \"Moderation\", the band asked to be and was granted a release from their contract from Universal Records.  Two songs, \"Shoot to Kill\", also from \"Devil Thumbs a Ride\", and \"If\", from \"Grip\", reached No. 42 on Billboard's Dance/Club Play chart.  The band has released six albums: two on Universal Records and four on independent labels.

Matthew has no census, annunciation to the shepherds or presentation in the Temple, implies that Jesus's parents' home is Bethlehem, and has him born in a house there, and has an unnamed angel appear to Joseph to announce the birth.  In Luke there are no Magi, no flight into Egypt, or Massacre of the Innocents, Joseph is a resident of Nazareth, the birth appears to take place in an inn instead of the family home, and the angel (named as Gabriel) announces the coming birth to Mary.

It is a proposed solution to the Synoptic Problem, which concerns the pattern of similarities and differences between the three Gospels of Matthew, Mark, and Luke.  The hypothesis, following an original proposal by Augustine and expanded by Johann Jakob Griesbach (it was once called the Griesbach hypothesis), was introduced in its current form by William Farmer in 1964.  This hypothesis is the most serious alternative to the two-source hypothesis.  Its main advantages over the two-source hypothesis include the fact that it relies not just on internal evidence, that it does not require lost sources like the Q document, and that it is supported by the view of the early Church.  Unlike the two-source hypothesis, the two-gospel hypothesis concludes that the traditional accounts of the gospels (order and date of publication, as well as authorship) are accurate.

The hypothesis holds that Matthew was written first, by Matthew the Evangelist (see the Gospel According to the Hebrews and the Jewish-Christian Gospels ).  Mark the Evangelist wrote the Gospel of Mark second and used Matthew and the preaching of Peter as sources.  Luke the Evangelist wrote the Gospel of Luke and was aware of the two Gospels that preceded him.  Unlike some competing hypotheses, this hypothesis does not rely on, nor does it argue for, the existence of any document that is not explicitly mentioned in historical testimony.  Instead, the hypothesis draws primarily upon historical testimony, rather than textual criticism, as the central line of evidence.  The foundation of evidence for the hypothesis is the writings of the Church Fathers: historical sources dating back to as early as the first half of the 2nd century, which have been held as authoritative by most Christians for nearly two millennia.  Adherents to the Augustinian hypothesis view it as a simple, coherent solution to the synoptic problem."

Launched on 29 September 1977 by a Proton rocket, the station was the first of the 'second-generation' type of space station.  Salyut 6 possessed several revolutionary advances over the earlier Soviet space stations, which it nevertheless resembled in overall design.  These included the addition of a second docking port, a new main propulsion system and the station's primary scientific instrument, the BST-1M multispectral telescope.  The addition of the second docking port made crew handovers and station resupply by unmanned Progress freighters possible for the first time.  The early Salyut stations had no means of resupply or removing accumulated garbage (aside from the limited amount that cosmonauts could carry in their Soyuz spacecraft), nor could the propulsion system be refueled once it exhausted its propellant supply.  Consequently, once the consumables launched with the station were used up, its mission had to be concluded and as a result, manned missions had a maximum duration of three months.

            "7. Sexual racism: Sexual racism is the \"sexual rejection of the racial minority, the conscious attempt on the part of the majority to prevent interracial cohabitation.\"  It is the discrimination between potential sexual or romantic partners on the basis of perceived racial identity.  However, not everyone agrees that this should be classified as racism, some argue that distinguishing among partners on the basis of perceived race is not racism at all but a justifiable personal preference.  The origins of sexual racism can be explained by looking at its history, especially in the USA, where the abolition of slavery and the Reconstruction Era had significant impacts on interracial mixing.  Attitudes towards interracial relationships, and indeed marriage, have increased in positivity in the last 50 years.  In 1968, 73% of US citizens disapproved of the right to marry inter-racially, whereas this figure dropped to 17% by 2007, this illustrating the reduction in discriminatory attitudes towards interracial dating.  Irrespective of this, there still remains the issue of sexual racism in the online dating world, in that preferences appear to follow a racial hierarchy.  The exclusion of races dissimilar to one's own is a main feature of sexual racism, however a reluctance to date inter-racially predominantly spans from the discriminatory views often possessed by those in society, as opposed to purely a same-race individual preference.  Moreover, this racial discrimination also deviates into the form of the sexual dehumanisation of individuals of other racial identities.  Sharing the basic premise, originating from the 'taboo' nature of interracial relations, individuals of other racial groups are classified as forbidden sexual objects; the result of a racial fetish.  This sexualised reductionism is, concurrently, a form of sexual racism.",

Its history in Europe among various Christian primitivistic movements has been well documented.  The followers of Jacob Cochran as early as 1818 used \"spiritual wifery\" to describe their religious doctrine of free love.  Often confused with polygamy, spiritual wifery among the Cochranites was the practice in which communal mates were temporarily assigned and reassigned, either by personal preference or religious authority.",

            "2. Musturzabalsuchus: Musturzabalsuchus is an extinct genus of crocodylian, and one of the oldest known members of the superfamily Alligatoroidea.  The generic name means \"Broadened rostrum crocodile\", with \"Musturzabal\" meaning \"broadened rostrum\" in Basque and \"suchus\" meaning \"crocodile\" in Greek.  The type and only species is \"M. buffetauti\", named after the French paleoherpetologist Eric Buffetaut.  The material first assigned to \"Musturzabalsuchus\" in 1997 has been found from the locality of La\u00f1o in Condado de Trevi\u00f1o, northern Spain.  Although dating back to the Late Cretaceous, the exact age of the strata in which material of \"Musturzabalsuchus\" occurs in the locality is not known: it is either Late Campanian or very Early Maastrichtian.  Despite the unusually high quantity of remains belonging to the genus (most other continental Late Cretaceous crocodilian genera from Europe are poorly represented), the only skeletal elements known from \"Musturzabalsuchus\" are the maxilla and mandible.  Some fragments of these bones have been found from the locality of Armu\u00f1a in the province of Segovia that were previously referred to an unnamed trematochampsid.  Like the holotype and paratype material found from La\u00f1o, these fossils, known collectively as UPUAM-502, are Campano-Maastrichtian in age.  Another specimen (MHNM 10834.0) from the Fuvelian Lignites of France has been referred to \"Musturzabalsuchus\" in 1999.  However, the characteristics used to assign the material to better-known specimens of \"Musturzabalsuchus\" from Spain were questioned in a later study.  Material from \"Musturzabalsuchus\" has been found more recently from Valencia, Spain, being slightly older in age than specimens from other localities, dating back to the Early or Middle Campanian.",
            "3. Cantar de los Siete Infantes de Lara: The Cantar de los Siete Infantes de Lara (Song of the Seven Lara Princes) is a legend, perhaps derived from a lost \"cantar de gesta\", that relates a tale of family feuding and revenge, centering on the murder of the eponymous seven \"infantes\", princes, of Lara or Salas.  The legend survives in prose form in medieval chronicles, the oldest being in the extended version of the \"Estoria de Espa\u00f1a\" (History of Spain) compiles during the reign of Sancho IV of Castile, before 1289 (edited by Ram\u00f3n Men\u00e9ndez Pidal under the name \"Primera Cr\u00f3nica General\").  From the account found in this chronicle as well as mention in the \"Cr\u00f3nica de 1344\" (\"Segunda Cr\u00f3nica General\") and interpolations into a copy of the \"Tercera Cr\u00f3nica General\" dating from 1512, Men\u00e9ndez Pidal found evidence for the existence of an ancient \"cantar de gesta\", lost but partially reconstructed, dating back to the year 1000, that would, along with the \"Cantar de Mio Cid\" and the \"Poema de Fern\u00e1n Gonz\u00e1lez\", represent one of the most important epic \"cantares\" of Castilian literature, and the most primitive example of the Spanish epic.  The legendary tradition of the \"Infantes de Lara\" has also been developed though ballads.  Some more recent scholars have rejected this, dating the story to shortly before the surviving prose versions.  The \"Infantes de Lara\" were the children of Castilian nobleman Gonzalo Gustioz of Lara or Salas and his wife \"\"Do\u00f1a Sancha\"\" (lady Sancha).  The story revolves around a family feud, an escalating tit-for-tat cycle of revenge, between their family and that of Sancha's brother, Ruy Vel\u00e1zquez and his wife \"Do\u00f1a\" Lambra. <ref name=\"Barton137/8\">Barton, pp. 137\u2013138</ref>",
